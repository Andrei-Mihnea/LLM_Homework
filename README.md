## 🔍 Overview

**LLM_Homework** is an AI-powered toolkit for building a conversational **smart librarian assistant**.  
It combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **custom tool completion**, enabling AI to fetch book information, provide summaries, and interact intelligently with user queries.

### ✨ Core Features
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture** – Separation of controllers, views, and services for scalable development.  
- 📖 **AI-Powered Library Assistance** – Uses OpenAI LLMs with **ChromaDB** as a vector store for semantic search.  
- 🔒 **Secure Authentication** – JWT-based login and session management (planned).  
- 🌐 **REST API** – Flask backend with modular API endpoints for assistant interaction.  
- 📦 **Containerized Deployment** – Ready-to-run with **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.
